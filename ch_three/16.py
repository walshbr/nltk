# ☼ Use a text editor to create a file called prog.py containing the single line monty = 'Monty Python'. Next, start up a new session with the
# Python interpreter, and enter the expression monty at the prompt. You will get an error from the interpreter. Now, try the following (note that
# you have to leave off the .py part of the filename):
# >>> from prog import monty
# >>> monty
# This time, Python should return with a value. You can also try import prog, in which case Python should be able to evaluate the expression
# prog.monty at the prompt.

"""Question for Eric - when you're importing modules, it imports the variables and everything
too - not just the methods/functions?"
