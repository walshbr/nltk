# ◑ The index() function can be used to look up items in sequences. For example, 'inexpressible'.index('e') tells us the index of the first position of the letter e.

# What happens when you look up a substring, e.g. 'inexpressible'.index('re')?

# Define a variable words containing a list of words. Now use words.index() to look up the position of an individual word.

# Define a variable silly as in the exercise above. Use the index() function in combination with list slicing to build a list phrase consisting of all the words up to (but not including) in in silly.

words = 'function in combination with list slicing to build a list phrase consisting of all the words up to (but not including) in in silly.'

words = words.split(' ')

silly = 'newly formed bland ideas are inexpressible in an infuriating way'
